## Features

## Building

No special requirements. Just download the project, load it into Android Studio and let Gradle do its job.

Although this is an university project, pull requests are welcome. The only requirement is to reformat the code (with import optimization) in Android Studio before making a pull request to keep it nice and tidy.
